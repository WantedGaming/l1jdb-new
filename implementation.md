## Project Overview
A PHP/HTML5/CSS/BOOTSTRAP 5 database browser for the L1J Remastered game data with admin CRUD functionality. The site will feature a modern, card-based design with a clean, dark theme based on the specified color scheme.

**Main Categories:**
1. Weapons - (weapon.sql, weapon_skill.sql, weapon_skill_model.sql, weapons_skill_spell_def.sql)
2. Armor - (armor.sql, armor_set.sql)
3. Items - (etcitem.sql)
4. Monsters - (npc.sql filter by impl "L1Monster" + "L1Doppelganger", mobskill.sql, mobgroup.sql)
5. Maps - (mapids.sql)
6. Dolls - (npc.sql filter by impl "L1Doll", magicdoll_info.sql, magicdoll_potential.sql)
7. NPCs - (npc.sql filter by impl "L1Blackknight", "L1Dwarf", "L1Guard", "L1HouseKeeper", "L1Merchant", "L1Npc", "L1Teleporter")
8. Skills - (skills.sql, skills_hanlder.sql, skills_info.sql, skills_passive.sql)
